# Link Cleaner
Link Cleaner is a Progressive Web App for removing uncessesary parts of web links automatically, such as tracking code. It's built to open quickly and fully support the Web Share and Web Share Target APIs, so it can act as a filter for sharing links across applications.

Link Cleaner uses code from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
