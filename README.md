# Link Cleaner

Link Cleaner is a web app that removes unnecessary junk from web links in one click. The result can then be copied to the device clipboard, shared to another app or service, or displayed as a QR code for easy scanning.

Link Cleaner is primarily developed for mobile devices, as removing parts of links with a touchscreen keyboard is usually cumbersome, but it works perfectly well on desktop browsers as well.

### Features

- Works offline
- Bulk Mode for cleaning multiple links at once
- Uses the [Web Share Target API](https://w3c.github.io/web-share-target/) to recieve links from other applications (e.g. through the Share menu on Android devices)
- Uses [OpenSearch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch) to allow cleaning links from the search bar in some web browsers
- Uses the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API) to send cleaned links directly to other installed applications

### Privacy Policy

Link Cleaner uses [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) to report anonymous usage data, including how many times the app is open, how long it is used, the current country, and how many times links are cleaned. Links are **not** sent anywhere during or after cleaning. See the [PRIVACY.md](Privacy Policy) for more information.
